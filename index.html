        <p>
          I am a Postdoctoral Fellow at the HKU Business School. I received my
          PhD from the School of Economics and Management, Tsinghua University
          in June 2025.
        </p>
        <p>
          My research primarily focuses on patents, science, and innovation. I
          study how scientific knowledge contributes to technological progress
          and competitive advantage, and how policy or institutional shifts
          shape firms' innovation.
        </p>
        <p>
          On the one hand, I examine the growing role of Chinese science in
          U.S. innovation, showing that American firms engaged in scientific
          research are more likely to draw on this expanding cross-border
          knowledge base. On the other hand, I study how Chinese firms
          increasingly rely on science for innovation, and how U.S.-China
          geopolitical tensions have accelerated firms' engagement with science
          as an innovation input.
        </p>
        <p>
          At the same time, I also work on related topics in patent strategy,
          ESG, and entrepreneurship, including China's dual-filing patent
          practices, satellite-based measures of firms' actual carbon
          emissions, and entrepreneurship among patent agents.
