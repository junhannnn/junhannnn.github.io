          <h2>About</h2>
          <p>
            I am a Postdoctoral Fellow at the HKU Business School. I received
            my PhD from the School of Economics and Management, Tsinghua
            University in June 2025.
          </p>
          <p>
            My research primarily focuses on patents, science, and innovation.
            I study how scientific knowledge contributes to technological
            progress and competitive advantage, and how policy or institutional
            shifts shape firms' innovation.
          </p>
          <p>
            On the one hand, I examine the growing role of Chinese science in
            U.S. innovation, showing that American firms engaged in scientific
            research are more likely to draw on this expanding cross-border
            knowledge base. On the other hand, I study how Chinese firms
            increasingly rely on science for innovation, and how U.S.-China
            geopolitical tensions have accelerated firms' engagement with
            science as an innovation input.
          </p>
          <p>
            At the same time, I also work on related topics in patent strategy,
            ESG, and entrepreneurship, including China's dual-filing patent
            practices, satellite-based measures of firms' actual carbon
            emissions, and entrepreneurship among patent agents.
          </p>
